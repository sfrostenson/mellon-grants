REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


To the Board of Trustees of
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements
of activities and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the finan-
cial position of The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (the "Foundation") at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the change in its net assets and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial state-
ments are the responsibility of the Foundation's management; our respon-
sibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material mis-

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
  The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (the "Foundation"), a not-for-profit corporation
under the laws of the State of New York, is the result of the consolidation on June 30, 1969
of the Old Dominion Foundation into the Avalon Foundation with the name of the Avalon
Foundation being changed to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The Avalon Foundation
had been established in 1940 by Ailsa Mellon Bruce, Andrew W. Mellon's daughter.The Old
Dominion Foundation had been established in 1941 by Paul Mellon, Andrew W. Mellon's
son. The Foundation makes grants in four core program areas: higher education; museums
and art conservation; performing arts; and conservation and the environment. In addition
to grantmaking activities, Foundation staff engage in research in areas that support the
Foundation's mission, principally on issues that relate to higher education. In 2003 and
2002, the Foundation provided major start-up support for two digital initiatives (ARTstor
Inc. and Ithaka Harbors, Inc.) which became independent not-for-profit entities in 2003.
  The financial statements of the Foundation have been prepared in conformity with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles. The significant accounting policies followed are
described below.

Investments:
   Investments in marketable securities are stated at market value. Market value is deter-
mined using daily closing last trade prices, where available, for all tradeable instruments on
any global stock exchange. Realized gains and losses on investments in securities are calcu-
lated based on the first-in, first-out identification method.
   Limited liquidity investments are stated at estimated fair value. Limited liquidity invest-
ments are primarily made under agreements to participate in limited partnerships and are
generally subject to certain withdrawal restrictions. These investments are valued on the
basis of the Foundation's equity in the net assets of such partnerships. Values for these part-
nerships, which may include investments in both nonmarketable and market-traded securi-
ties, are provided by the general partner and may be based on historical cost, appraisals,
market values discounted for concentration of ownership, or other estimates. Because of the
inherent uncertainty of valuing the investments in such partnerships and certain of the
underlying investments held by the partnerships, the Foundation's estimate of fair value
may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for
the investments existed. The financial statements of the limited partnerships are audited
annually by independent auditing firms.
   The other investment is the Foundation's 100 percent interest in a trust which owns prop-
erty from which the Foundation receives the net income. Other income is principally the
                                                                                   125


income from this trust, derived from royalties from coal mining, with minor amounts of
income from timbering and oil and gas wells. The value of the Foundation's investment is
determined based on an estimate of the discounted value of the anticipated future income
from the remaining mineral reserves and of the value of the standing timber. The properties
are recorded at an estimated current value of $63.2 million at December 31, 2003 and
$73.5 million at December 31, 2002.

Grants:
  Grant appropriations include both conditional and unconditional grants. Unconditional
grants are expensed when appropriated. Certain grants are approved by the Trustees sub-
ject to the grantee fulfilling specific conditions, most frequently that all or a portion of the
grant funds be matched in a specified ratio. Such conditional grants are considered com-
mitments and are not recorded as expense until the conditions of the grant are met.
Substantially all grants payable are due within one year and are recorded at face value.

Taxes:
  The Foundation qualifies as a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code and, accordingly, is not subject to federal income taxes. However,
the Foundation is subject to a federal excise tax. The Foundation follows the policy
of providing for federal excise tax on the net appreciation (both realized and unrealized) of
investments. The deferred federal excise tax in the accompanying financial statements rep-
resents tax provided on the net unrealized appreciation of investments. The Foundation is
subject to income tax at corporate rates on certain income that is considered unrelated busi-
ness income under the Internal Revenue Code.

Property:
  Property primarily consists of land, buildings, and their improvements, located in New
York City. These buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives,
generally twenty-five to twenty-eight years.

Investment Return:
  Investment return includes income and realized and unrealized gains or losses on all
investments. Unrealized gain or loss comprises the change in unrealized appreciation on
marketable securities and the limited liquidity investments, net of deferred federal excise tax
provided on such unrealized appreciation. Realized gains or losses include gains or losses
realized on the sale of marketable securities and the Foundation's share of the operating
results of the partnership investments, whether distributed or undistributed.

Expenses:
   "Grantmaking operations" includes all costs related to appropriating, paying and admin-
istering grants. "Direct charitable activities" are the active programs conducted by the
Foundation. "Investment operations" include the costs of supervising the Foundation's
investment portfolio. "Current provision for taxes" includes federal and state taxes. "Other
expenses" include certain expenses that the Foundation is not permitted to report either as
an expense of distribution or an expense of earning income.
   Salaries and benefits are allocated to each activity listed above, and also to "core
administration," based on estimates of the time each staff member devoted to that activity.
"Core administration" expenses are then prorated among the activities listed above on the
basis of the direct salary allocations. Identifiable costs, such as consultants, are charged
directly to each activity.
Amounts for program grants, grantmaking operations, and direct charitable activities shown
on the Statement of Activities will not agree with the amounts on the Foundation's Form
990PF, the federal excise tax return, because a cash basis is required for reporting the
        126



Notes to Financial Statements, (continued)
expenses of distribution for tax purposes as contrasted with the accrual basis used in
preparing the accompanying financial statements.
   The administrative expenses of distribution, including direct charitable activities, were
$22.3 million (12.6% of grants made) in 2003 compared to $16.4 million (7.7% of grants
made) in 2002. The increases in 2003 are primarily due to increases in expenditures for
"direct charitable activities," and especially to increases in expenditures for the Founda-
tion's digital initiatives (ARTstor Inc. and Ithaka Harbors, Inc.).
   "Investment management expenses" are the direct costs of portfolio management, includ-
ing fees for investment management, custody, and advisory services.
   The Foundation's expenses by natural classification are as follows for 2003 and 2002
                                                           22003           22002

Use of Estimates:
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted account-
ing principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications
  Certain 2002 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation.

   As a result of its investing strategies, the Foundation is a party to a variety of financial
instruments.These financial instruments may include equity, fixed income, and foreign cur-
rency futures and options contracts, foreign currency forwards, and interest rate cap and
floor contracts. Much of the Foundation's off-balance-sheet exposure represents strategies
that are designed to reduce the interest rate and market risk inherent in portions of the
Foundation's investment program. Changes in the market values of these financial instru-
ments are recognized currently in the Statement of Activities.
                                                                                   127


   Through certain investment managers, the Foundation purchases and sells forward cur-
rency contracts whereby the Foundation agrees to exchange one currency for another on an
agreed-upon date at an agreed-upon exchange rate to minimize the exposure of certain of
its marketable securities to adverse fluctuations in financial and currency markets. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Foundation had forward currency contracts with
notional amounts totaling $1.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. At December 31,
2003, approximately $1.2 million in assets and $1.2 million in liabilities related to open for-
eign currency contracts, at market value, are included in derivative financial instruments.
   Through a securities lending program managed by its investment custodian, the
Foundation loans certain stocks and bonds included in its investment portfolio to qualified
investors. The custodian maintains collateral in excess of the value of the securities on loan.
The Foundation's investment custodian has indemnified the program against counterparty
risk. The Foundation's gross securities loaned to certain investors at December 31, 2003
and 2002 amounted to approximately $522 million and $272 million, respectively.
   Financial instruments such as those described above involve, to varying degrees, elements
of market risk and credit risk in excess of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
Market risk represents the potential loss the Foundation faces due to the decrease in
the value of financial instruments. Credit risk represents the maximum potential loss the
Foundation faces due to possible non-performance by obligors and counterparties of the terms
of their contracts.
   Management does not anticipate that losses, if any, resulting from its market or credit
risks would materially affect the financial position and operations of the Foundation.
   Pursuant to its limited partnership agreements, the Foundation is committed to con-
tribute approximately $368 million as of December 31, 2003 in additional capital over the
next ten years. Unpaid commitments at December 31, 2002 were $470 million.

NOTE 3--BONDS PAYABLE:
   In December 2002, the Foundation issued $28.5 million in taxable term bonds with a
final maturity of December 1, 2032 (The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Series 2002 Bonds
(the "Bonds")). The proceeds from the Bonds were used in 2002 for the acquistion of facil-
ities owned by the Foundation in New York City and in 2003 for the improvement and reha-
bilitation of such facilities. The Bonds bear interest, payable monthly, based upon results of
monthly auction procedures. The average interest rate applicable in 2003, was 1.25%.
Management believes that the market value of the bonds approximates the book value. The
Bonds represent an unsecured general obligation of the Foundation. The Bonds are rated
Aaa by Moody's Investor Services and AAA by Standard & Poor's Rating Services. Interest
incurred in 2003 was $357 thousand of which $232 thousand was capitalized in connection
with the project.

NOTE 4--TAXES:
   The Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on private foundations equal to 2 per-
cent of net investment income (principally interest, dividends, and net realized capital gains,
less expenses incurred in the production of investment income).This tax is reduced to 1 per-
cent when a foundation meets certain distribution requirements under Section 4940(e) of
the Internal Revenue Code.The Foundation qualified for the 1 percent tax rate in 2003 and
2002. Certain income defined as unrelated business income by the Code may be subject to
tax at ordinary corporate rates.
   The provision for taxes consists of a current provision for the federal excise taxes on net
investment income and federal and state taxes on unrelated business income and a deferred
provision on the change in unrealized appreciation of investments. The current tax provi-
sion for 2003 comprises $1.9 million of federal excise tax on net investment income and
$294 thousand in federal and state taxes on unrelated business income. The current provi-
sion in 2002 was $203 thousand of federal excise tax on net investment income and $486
       128



Notes to Financial Statements, (continued)
thousand in federal and state taxes on unrelated business income. The change in unrealized
appreciation reflected on the Statement of Activities includes a provision for deferred taxes
based on net unrealized appreciation of investments at 2 percent.The increase in unrealized
appreciation in 2003 resulted in an increase of the deferred federal excise tax liability of
$11.0 million. In 2002, the deferred federal excise tax liability decreased by $1.4 million.

tions approved during 2003.The grants payable and committed at December 31, 2002 have
